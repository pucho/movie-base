# MovieBase

Moviebase is hosted [here](https://movie-base.vercel.app/)

## Running this project locally

You will need an api key from [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

After you have your api key, create a .env file in the root of this project and add the key to the file like this:
`REACT_APP_MOVIEDB_API_KEY="<YOURMOVIEDBAPIKEY>"`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
